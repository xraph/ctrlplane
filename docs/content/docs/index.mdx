description: A composable Go library for deploying and managing SaaS instances at scale.
---

Ctrl Plane is a Go library that handles the hard parts of multi-tenant SaaS infrastructure: provisioning instances, deploying code, checking health, managing secrets, routing traffic, and collecting telemetry. You bring your cloud provider and your auth system. Ctrl Plane wires everything together.

It works in two modes. You can embed it directly into any Go application as a library, or mount it into a [Forge](https://github.com/xraph/forge) application as an extension. Either way, the API surface is the same.

## What it does

- **Instance lifecycle** -- Create, start, stop, scale, suspend, and destroy tenant instances across any cloud provider.
- **Deployments** -- Push new releases with rolling, blue-green, canary, or recreate strategies. Roll back to any previous release.
- **Health monitoring** -- Configure HTTP, TCP, gRPC, or command-based health checks per instance. Track status history and get aggregate health views.
- **Networking** -- Manage custom domains, TLS certificates, and traffic routes per instance.
- **Secrets** -- Store and inject environment variables, files, and registry credentials with an optional vault backend.
- **Events** -- Publish and subscribe to lifecycle events across all subsystems. Deliver webhooks to external systems.
- **Telemetry** -- Collect metrics, logs, traces, and resource snapshots. Query them through a unified interface.
- **Multi-tenancy** -- Every operation is scoped to a tenant. Quotas, audit logging, and tenant suspension are built in.

## Design philosophy

Ctrl Plane was built with a few principles in mind:

**Library, not framework.** Ctrl Plane is a set of Go packages you import, not a binary you deploy. You control the `main` function, the HTTP server, and the process lifecycle.

**Interfaces over implementations.** Every subsystem defines a Go interface. The library ships with defaults (in-memory store, Docker provider, built-in health checkers), but you can replace any piece with your own implementation.

**Provider agnostic.** The `provider.Provider` interface abstracts over Kubernetes, Docker, AWS ECS, Fly.io, Nomad, and anything else. Instances don't know or care which orchestrator runs them.

**Multi-tenant by default.** Tenant scoping isn't an afterthought. Every store query filters by tenant ID. Every API request is authenticated and authorized. Quotas and audit trails are part of the core, not plugins.

## Quick look

Use Ctrl Plane as a Forge extension for the simplest setup:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"

    "github.com/xraph/forge"

    "github.com/xraph/ctrlplane/app"
    "github.com/xraph/ctrlplane/extension"
    "github.com/xraph/ctrlplane/provider/docker"
    "github.com/xraph/ctrlplane/store/memory"
)

func main() {
    // Create a Forge app with OpenAPI docs
    forgeApp := forge.New(
        forge.WithAppName("ctrlplane"),
        forge.WithAppVersion("0.1.0"),
    )

    // Register Ctrl Plane as an extension
    cpExt := extension.New(
        extension.WithStore(app.WithStore(memory.New())),
        extension.WithProvider("docker", docker.New(docker.Config{})),
    )

    forgeApp.RegisterExtension(cpExt)
    log.Fatal(forgeApp.Run())
}
```
